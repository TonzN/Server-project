# First blog

Started a small blogpost and this is the first blog!!

## Changes
Started working on db_stream.py 

To improve efficiency and avoid unwanted added complexity networking and database accessing is gonna be exclusively async i/o
Async is becoming the industry standard and after a lot of thinking i decided im gonna jump on the same train
Threading adds unneccecary overhead and complexity and performance wise wont make a ton of difference compared to better async methods. 

### Database stream
At this moment data from the server manager sends back to client for every server request, this is quite inefficient and wont stack well whith high traffic and lots of different calls from different users.

To solve this data is gonna get streamed back to users in chunks from a buffer in a clock cycle. 
Doing this all users gets data in a relatively equall time only limited by their own network speed.
Easier to manage problems if data doesnt get sent or connectivity issues.
Can send more data at once but consistantly not letting a big database query block the loop. 

### Thread manager
Synchronious work that might be blocking for some time or multiple tasks needing to be done at once will need a thread manager to safely handle it to prevent loose threads and so on.
